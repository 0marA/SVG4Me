# SVG4Me

SVG4Me is an application for MacOS and Windows to view all of the SVGs inside of a folder. You can either drag and drop a file or folder or browse for a folder with the built in file explorer. To download, click on releases on the right side of this page. Its recommended to only use around 50 SVGs at a time. Built with ❤️ for my mom.
